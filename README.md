Hi.
This is my Second Task of Introducing the Neon Glitch Calculator! for CODSOFT.
🔢 I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a stylish calculator with a neon glitch effect. The buttons have a dynamic, pulsating glow, inspired by a vibrant neon disco theme.
🌐 Check out how cool and futuristic it looks with the new neon glitch animation!
💡 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🎨 Features: Neon glow, glitch animation, stylish design
Stay tuned for more exciting projects!
